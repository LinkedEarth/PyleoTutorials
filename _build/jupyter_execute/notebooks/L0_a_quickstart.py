# None. This tutorial assumes basic knowledge of Python. If you are not familiar with this coding language, check out this tutorial: http://linked.earth/ec_workshops_py/.
# 
# ### Relevant Packages
# 
# Pandas; Matplotlib
# 
# ## Data Description
# 
# Sea-surface temperature from [Kaplan (1998)](https://psl.noaa.gov/data/gridded/data.kaplan_sst.html) averaged over the NINO3 (5N-5S, 150W-190E)) region.
# 
# 
# ## Demonstration
# 
# Let's import the packages needed for this tutorial:

# In[1]:


import pyleoclim as pyleo
import pandas as pd


# ### Step 1: Create a `Series` object from a csv file
# 
# To do so, we will first read the data from a csv file and load into a [Pandas DataFrame](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html):

# In[2]:


df = pd.read_csv('../data/wtc_test_data_nino_even.csv')
df.head()


# Next we create a `Series` object from the columns of the `DataFrame`:

# In[3]:


ts_nino = pyleo.Series(time =  df['t'], value = df['nino'], label = 'Kaplan Ni√±o3 SST',
                  time_name = 'Year', value_name = 'NINO3 index',
                  time_unit = 'CE',   value_unit = '$^{\circ}$C')            


# Let's make a simple plot. You can learn to customize this plot in the `publication_ready_figures.ipynb` tutorial:

# In[4]:


fig, ax = ts_nino.plot()


# ### Step 2: Pre-processing
# 
# Pyleoclim has multiple functionalities to pre-process a timeseries, including standardizing, detrending, interpolation. You can learn about the various pre-processing steps in the `L0_basic_ts_manipulation.ipynb`, `L1_filtering_and_detrending.ipynb`,  and `L1_uniform_time_sampling.ipynb` tutorials. As an example of one treatment, let's standardize the data and plot it against the original values. 

# In[5]:


ts_nino_std = ts_nino.standardize()

fig, ax = ts_nino.plot(label='original', zorder=99) # a high zorder ensures this is plotted on top
ax = ts_nino_std.plot(label='standardized', ax=ax, lgd_kwargs={'ncol': 2})


# For more on graphics customizations,  see *L1_figures_with_multiple_panels.ipynb*, *L1_publication_read_figures.ipynb*

# ### Step 3: Spectral Analysis
# 
# Pyleoclim makes it simple to perform spectral analysis. Calling the `.spectral()` method will yield a `PSD` (power spectral density) object of the corresponding series. Unless specified otherwise, `.spectral()` uses the Lomb-Scargle periodogram (`method='lomb_scargle`), which can handle both evenly-spaced data and unevenly-spaced data with great speed. However, it has known biases,  so it may be appropriate to specify an alternative method, like the Multi-Taper Method, which can only handle evenly-spaced data.  For our example data, both methods apply.

# In[6]:


psd_wwz = ts_nino_std.spectral()  # method='lomb-scargle' by default 
psd_mtm = ts_nino_std.spectral(method='mtm')  # method='mtm' 


# We can then plot the results of our analyses on the same figure:

# In[7]:


fig, ax = psd_wwz.plot(label='Lomb-Scargle',zorder=99)
ax = psd_mtm.plot(ax=ax, label='MTM')


# To identify notable periodicities, we need to perform some significance test.
# Currently, *Pyleoclim* supports the test against an AR(1) benchmark, which can be performed by simply calling the `signif_test()` method, which uses 200 surrogate series by default:

# In[8]:


psd_mtm_signif = ts_nino_std.spectral(method='mtm').signif_test()


# Calling the `plot()` method on our `psd_mtm_signif` object will return a plot of the PSD along with the AR(1) threshold curve, which we can use to identify the significant cycles.

# In[9]:


fig, ax = psd_mtm_signif.plot()


# For more details, see the *L2_spectral_analysis.ipynb* notebook.

# ### Step 4: Wavelet Analysis

# The current version of *Pyleoclim* supports the `wwz` method for wavelet analysis on unevenly-spaced records and the `cwt` method for evenly-spaced records. `wwz` is more flexible than `cwt` in the sense that it can be used on any record, but is much slower (no free lunch!). To perform wavelet analysis we simply call the `wavelet()` method, which will in turn create a `Scalogram` object. Since our data is evenly spaced, we'll use `cwt`, which is the default:

# In[10]:


scal = ts_nino_std.wavelet() 


# In[11]:


fig, ax = scal.plot() 


# Notice how the title got built automatically from the figure metadata.  We can also perform significance analysis the same way we did when conducting spectral analysis:

# In[12]:


scal_signif = ts_nino_std.wavelet().signif_test()


# In this case, regions of significance (those that exceed the 95% confidence threshold found using AR1 surrogates) will be outlined in white.

# In[14]:


fig, ax = scal_signif.plot()


# For more details, see the *L2_wavelet_analysis.ipynb* notebook.
# 
# ### One more thing: method cascading
# 
# Life is short. `Pyleoclim` provides a very cool feature to make life a little bit easier: "method cascading". This feature allows us to string together the steps of a multi-step workflow in just one line.

# In[15]:


#Spectral analysis with a significance test
fig, ax = ts_nino.standardize().spectral(method='mtm').signif_test().plot()


# In[16]:


#Wavelet analysis with significance test
fig, ax = ts_nino.standardize().wavelet().signif_test().plot()
