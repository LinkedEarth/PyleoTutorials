@article{kirchner_aliasing_2005,
	abstract = {The scaling exponent of a 1/f(alpha) noise time series is commonly estimated from the power-law slope of its Fourier power spectrum. Here I show that because 1/f(alpha) noises typically have significant power above the Nyquist frequency, measurements of their power spectra will often be severely distorted by aliasing, not only near the Nyquist frequency, but also far below it. I show that spectral aliasing typically leads to large systematic biases in the scaling exponents, and thus the fractal dimensions, that are estimated from the power-law slopes of 1/f(alpha) noise spectra. I describe a simple spectral filtering method that corrects the distortions introduced by spectral aliasing, and recovers the broadband spectrum of 1/f(alpha) noises. Like a Wiener filter, this filtering method does not require that the correct spectrum is known in advance. I illustrate this filtering technique using two environmental noise spectra that are distorted by aliasing.},

@article{menviel_deconstructing_2011,
	abstract = {Using an Earth system model of intermediate complexity forced by continuously varying boundary conditions and a hypothetical profile of freshwater forcing, the model simulates Heinrich event 1 (H1), the B{\o}lling warm period, the Older Dryas, the Antarctic Cold Reversal (ACR) and the Younger Dryas in close agreement with paleo-proxy data from different regions worldwide. The ACR can be simulated as the bipolar seesaw response to the AMOC recovery during the termination of H1. However, this study also demonstrates that the amplitude of the ACR can be further amplified by a rapid deglacial retreat of the Antarctic Ice sheets. We suggest that melting from both, the Laurentide and the Antarctic Ice sheets contributed to the sea level rise associated with Meltwater Pulse 1-A (MWP-1A). It is hypothesized that the northern hemispheric source of MWP-1A caused the Older Dryas cooling in the Northern Hemisphere, whereas the Southern Hemispheric source contributed to the ACR. The study also documents that for the majority of paleo-climate proxies considered here, the relative timing can be qualitatively reproduced by the transient modeling experiments. The climate model solution presented here may provide a means to further constrain dating uncertainties of some of paleo-climate proxies during the Last Glacial Termination.},

@article{liu_transient_2009,
	abstract = {We conducted the first synchronously coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation model simulation from the Last Glacial Maximum to the B{\o}lling-Aller{\o}d ({BA}) warming. Our model reproduces several major features of the deglacial climate evolution, suggesting a good agreement in climate sensitivity between the model and observations. In particular, our model simulates the abrupt {BA} warming as a transient response of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation ({AMOC}) to a sudden termination of freshwater discharge to the North Atlantic before the {BA}. In contrast to previous mechanisms that invoke {AMOC} multiple equilibrium and Southern Hemisphere climate forcing, we propose that the {BA} transition is caused by the superposition of climatic responses to the transient {CO}2 forcing, the {AMOC} recovery from Heinrich Event 1, and an {AMOC} overshoot.

Previous studies have identified disagreements between paleoclimate reconstructions and climate model simulations with respect to the magnitude and recovery from volcanic cooling, questioning the fidelity of climate model simulations, reconstructions, or both. Using the paleoenvironmental data assimilation framework of the Last Millennium Reanalysis, this study investigates the causes of the disagreements, using both real and simulated data. We demonstrate that discrepancies since 1600 CE can be largely resolved by assimilating tree-ring density records only, targeting growing season temperature instead of annual temperature, and performing the comparison at proxy locales. Simulations of eruptions earlier in the last millennium may also reflect uncertainties in forcing and modeled aerosol microphysics.},

	abstract = {The potential for explosive volcanism to affect the El Ni{\~n}o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) has been debated since the 1980s. Several observational studies, based largely on tree-ring proxies, have since found support for a positive ENSO phase in the year following large eruptions. In contrast, recent coral data from the heart of the tropical Pacific suggest no uniform ENSO response to explosive volcanism over the last millennium. Here we leverage paleoclimate data assimilation to integrate both tree-ring and coral proxies into a reconstruction of ENSO state, and re-appraise this relationship. We find only a weak statistical association between volcanism and ENSO, and identify the selection of volcanic events as a key variable to the conclusion. We discuss the difficulties of conclusively establishing a volcanic influence on ENSO by empirical means, given the myriad factors affecting the response, including the spatiotemporal details of the forcing and ENSO phase preconditioning.},

	abstract = {Precipitation in southwestern North America has exhibited significant natural variability over the past few thousand years(1). This variability has been attributed to sea surface temperature regimes in the Pacific and Atlantic oceans, and to the attendant shifts in atmospheric circulation patterns(1,2). In particular, decadal variability in the North Pacific has influenced precipitation in this region during the twentieth century(3,4), but links to earlier droughts and pluvials are unclear. Here we assess these links using delta O-18 data from a speleothem from southern California that spans AD 854-2007. We show that variations in the oxygen isotopes of the speleothem correlate to sea surface temperatures in the Kuroshio Extension region(5) of the North Pacific, which affect the atmospheric trajectory and isotopic composition of moisture reaching the study site. Interpreting our speleothem data as a record of sea surface temperatures in the Kuroshio Extension, we find a strong 22-year periodicity, suggesting a persistent solar influence(6) on North Pacific decadal variability. A comparison with tree-ring records of precipitation(1) during the past millennium shows that some droughts occurred during periods of warmth in the Kuroshio Extension, similar to the instrumental record(4). However, other droughts did not and instead must have been influenced by other factors. Finally, we find a significant increase in sea surface temperature variability over the past 150 years, which may reflect an influence of greenhouse gas concentrations on variability in the North Pacific.},

 data collection, data preparation, analytics, predictive modelling, and
 simulation that lead to new data products. They can inherently contribute to the
 FAIR data principles: by processing data according to established metadata; by
 creating metadata themselves during the processing of data; and by tracking and
 recording data provenance. These properties aid data quality assessment and
 contribute to secondary data usage. Moreover, workflows are digital objects in
 their own right. This paper argues that FAIR principles for workflows need to
 address their specific nature in terms of their composition of executable
 software steps, their provenance, and their development.}",

@article{Liang:2013,
	Abstract = {Information flow, or information transfer as it may be referred to, is a fundamental notion in general physics which has wide applications in scientific disciplines. Recently, a rigorous formalism has been established with respect to both deterministic and stochastic systems, with flow measures explicitly obtained. These measures possess some important properties, among which is flow or transfer asymmetry. The formalism has been validated and put to application with a variety of benchmark systems, such as the baker transformation, H{\'e}non map, truncated Burgers-Hopf system, Langevin equation, etc. In the chaotic Burgers-Hopf system, all the transfers, save for one, are essentially zero, indicating that the processes underlying a dynamical phenomenon, albeit complex, could be simple. (Truth is simple.) In the Langevin equation case, it is found that there could be no information flowing from one certain time series to another series, though the two are highly correlated. Information flow/transfer provides a potential measure of the cause--effect relation between dynamical events, a relation usually hidden behind the correlation in a traditional sense.},
