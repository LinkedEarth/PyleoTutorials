<h3>Introduction:<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>In many cases we are interested in looking at, and thinking about, multiple time series at the same time. Here we introduce the <a class="reference external" href="https://pyleoclim-util.readthedocs.io/en/latest/core/api.html#multipleseries-pyleoclim-multipleseries">MultipleSeries</a> object, which serves as the basis of the various analysis techniques that apply specifically to analyzing and visualizing multiple <a class="reference external" href="https://pyleoclim-util.readthedocs.io/en/latest/core/api.html#series-pyleoclim-series">Series</a> objects. We also look at the <a class="reference external" href="https://pyleoclim-util.readthedocs.io/en/latest/core/api.html#ensembleseries-pyleoclim-ensembleseries">EnsembleSeries</a>, a child class of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">MultipleSeries</span></code> with further capabilities.</p>

<p>Remember that <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\delta^{18}O\)</span> becomes more negative as temperature increases, hence the warming stripes on this figure are “reversed”, with warmer temperatures in blue.

<p>By default, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.common_time()</span></code> interpolates and infers spacing from the records involved and returns a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">MultipleSeries</span></code> that spans the full shared interval. However, these parameters can be tuned. For example, in addition to interpolation, it also allows binning and a Gaussian kernel. Downsampling is a simple matter of specifying the preferred value for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">step</span></code>, and focusing in on a subinterval of the shared interval is only a matter of assigning relevant date values to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">start</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">stop</span></code>.

<p>Alternatively, we can pass a color map and let pyleoclim figure out how to specify the colors. More information about
color maps is available in this <a class="reference external" href="https://matplotlib.org/stable/tutorials/colors/colormaps.html">Matplotlib tutorial</a>
on the subject. While it is possible to create colormaps from scratch, let’s go with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">tab20</span></code>. (Custom colormaps

<p>Notice how this option formats the index as a more recognizable variable (in this case, the age, in years BP here). However, when plotted, the units of the first series are used:</p>

<p>This correctly shows up as “ka” in this case. If some of the series in the collection have different units, all that needs to be done is to apply <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">convert_time_unit()</span></code> prior to plotting. Notice that we had flipped the LR04 values upon creating the object, so the values of all series in the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">MultipleSeries</span></code> vary in unison.</p>

<h3>Adding a series to a MultipleSeries object:<a class="headerlink" href="#adding-a-series-to-a-multipleseries-object" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>You could add another series to the previous collection using <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pyleo.MultipleSeries()</span></code>, but it would be rather tedious.
As of version 0.11.0, this operation can now be done with the “+” operator, which is understood to mean: “add this Series to the existing MultipleSeries object”. The method will confirm that you are not adding a series that is already in the MultipleSeries object by comparing it to the contents of the object, pairwise. For instance, let’s add the GISP2 timeseries:</p>

<h3>Plot traces<a class="headerlink" href="#plot-traces" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>In some cases, it can be informative to look at a set of individual traces. By default, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.plot_traces()</span></code> plots ten traces, but it is simple enough to set <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">num_traces</span></code> to another choice value.  The traces (however many) are chosen at random among the ensemble.  Random number generators start from a <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_seed">seed</a> number, so if it is important that the function yields the same plot each time it is rerun, set a value for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">seed</span></code> (always an integer).</p>

<p>Instead of looking at the full set of traces, it can be useful to look at an envelope that highlights various  features of the evolving distribution of the ensemble over time. By default, the quantiles displayed are [0.025, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 0.975], which means that it shows  95% confidence interval, the interquartile range (IQR), and the median. This plot can be customized for a different set of significance levels by passing a list of values to the parameter <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">qs</span></code>, in addition to various color, opacity, line style and label values.</p>
